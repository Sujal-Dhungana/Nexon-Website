This is a very pre-alpha version of my webiste called NEXON. 
NEXON is a online pc parts website where people can buy their pc parts at the lastest price. 
It has a cart which is locally stored so u can just store and close and come back the stuff int he cart will still be there.
Next is login as well, you can login or sign up if u dont have an account. Unfortunately, it only stores locally but ill try to make it secure. 
This is even mobile friendly. 
Because this is just a model and not offical, you cnnot check out the stuff you ordered im very sorry for that. 
Except that it is everything which a base website needs! I hope you like it.
